                                <p>The search box has rapidly become the default user interface for interacting with the catalog data in most eCommerce platforms.
                                </p>

                                <p>Even in scenarios where you are not explicitly searching, you may instead be consuming streams of content customized for your particular tastes and interests. Whether these be product recommendations, catalog browsing, items for purchase, or other content, you are likely still looking at filtered or ranked results and given the option to either page through or explictly filter the content with your own query.
                                </p>

                                <p>Furthermore, while not too long ago the expected response from a search box may have been simply returning 100 or 200 product results - a list of ranked products for a user to go through to find further information in response to their query. In the recent years the expectations for the intelligence-level of search technologies have sky-rocketed.

                                <li><strong>Domain-aware:</strong> understanding the entities, terminology, categories, and attributes of each specific use case and corpus of products, not just leveraging generic statitistics on strings of text.</li>
                                <li><strong>Contextual & Personalized:</strong> able to take user context (location, last search, profile, previous product interactions, user recommendations, and user classification), query context (other keywords, similar searches), and domain context (inventory, business rules, domain-specific terminology) in order to better understand user intent.</li>
                                <li><strong>Conversational:</strong> able to interact in natural language and guide users through a multi-step discovery process while learning and remembering relevant new information along the way.</li>

                                <li>Content and signals are the two sources of "fuel" to power an AI-powered search engine, with signals being the primary source for crowdsourced relevance.</li>
                                <li>Reflected Intelligence is the process of creating continuously-learning feedback loops that improve from each user interaction and reflect that learned intelligence back to automatically increase the relevance of future results.</li>
                                <li>Signals boosting is a form of "popularized" relevance, which usually has the biggest impact on your highest-volume, most popular queries.</li>
                                <li>Collaborative filtering is a form of "personalized" relevance, which is able to use patterns of user interaction with items to learn preferences of users or the strength of relationship between items, and to then recommend similar items based upon those learned relationships.</li>
                                <li>Learning to Rank is a form of "generalized" relevance, and is the process of training a ranking classifier based upon relevance judgements lists (queries mapped to correctly-ranked lists of documents) that can be applied to rank all documents and avoid the cold start problem.</li>
                                <li>Other kinds of Reflected Intelligence exist, including some techniques for leveraging content (instead of just signals) for crowdsourced relevance.</li>

                                <p>The goal of AI-powered search is to leverage automated learning techniques to deliver on these desired capabilities. While many organizations start with basic text search and spend many years trying to manually optimize synonyms lists, business rules, ontologies, field weights, and countless other aspects of their search configuration, some are beginning to realize that most of this process can actually be automated.
